## Introduction

### What is a Test Scenario?

A test scenario is a YAML file that describes:
- **What we're testing** - name and description
- **What network we use** - node topology
- **What actions we perform** - CLI commands
- **What result we expect** - checks

### Minimal Scenario Example

```yaml
name: Version Check
description: Ensure node responds to version command

network:
  topology: minimal
  nodes:
    - name: node1
      role: root

test:
  - cli: version
    expect: success
```

This scenario:
1. Creates 1 node (`minimal` topology)
2. Executes `version` command
3. Expects successful execution

### How to Run?

```bash
# Save scenario as scenarios/my_test.yml
./tests/stage-env/stage-env run-tests scenarios/my_test.yml
```

## Lesson 1: First Test

Let's create a complete test from scratch.

### Task
Create wallet and verify it appears in the list.

### Solution

Create file `scenarios/lesson1_wallet.yml`:

```yaml
# === METADATA ===
name: Lesson 1 - Wallet Creation
description: Learn how to create a wallet and verify it exists
tags: [tutorial, lesson1, basic]

# === NETWORK CONFIGURATION ===
network:
  topology: minimal        # Use 1 node
  nodes:
    - name: node1
      role: root
      validator: true

# === TEST ===
test:
  # Step 1: Create wallet
  - cli: wallet new -w my_first_wallet
    expect: success
    wait: 1s              # Wait 1 second

  # Step 2: Check it was created
  - cli: wallet list
    contains: my_first_wallet
```

### Running

```bash
./tests/stage-env/stage-env run-tests scenarios/lesson1_wallet.yml
```

### What Happens?

1. **stage-env** creates Docker container with node
2. Node starts and transitions to `ONLINE` state
3. Command `wallet new -w my_first_wallet` executes
4. System waits 1 second
5. Command `wallet list` executes
6. Checks that output contains `my_first_wallet`

### ‚úÖ Exercise 1

Create test that:
1. Creates wallet named `exercise1_wallet`
2. Creates second wallet named `exercise1_wallet2`
3. Checks that both wallets are in the list

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>

```yaml
name: Exercise 1 - Two Wallets
description: Create two wallets

network:
  topology: minimal
  nodes:
    - name: node1
      role: root

test:
  - cli: wallet new -w exercise1_wallet
    wait: 1s
  
  - cli: wallet new -w exercise1_wallet2
    wait: 1s
  
  - cli: wallet list
    contains: exercise1_wallet
  
  - cli: wallet list
    contains: exercise1_wallet2
```
</details>
