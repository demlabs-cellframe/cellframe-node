"""
ðŸ”€ Conditional Transaction Processor (Legacy Interface)

Legacy interface for conditional transactions. This module now serves
as a compatibility layer that re-exports the new modular ConditionalProcessor.

For new code, consider using the specialized processors directly:
- from cellframe.composer.cond import StakeLockProcessor
- from cellframe.composer.cond import ExchangeProcessor  
- from cellframe.composer.cond import VotingProcessor
- etc.

For backward compatibility, the original ConditionalProcessor interface
is maintained through the unified processor.
