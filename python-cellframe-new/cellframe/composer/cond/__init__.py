ðŸ”€ Conditional Transaction Processors

Modular conditional transaction processing framework with specialized processors
for different types of conditional transactions.

Architecture:
- BaseConditionalProcessor: Abstract base class with common functionality
- StakeLockProcessor: Stake lock operations with penalties and rewards
- ExchangeProcessor: Token exchange orders with market/limit pricing
- VotingProcessor: Voting proposals and governance operations
- ServicePaymentProcessor: Payments for network services
- DelegationProcessor: Stake delegation to validators

Usage:
    from cellframe.composer.cond import StakeLockProcessor, ExchangeProcessor
    from cellframe.composer import Composer
    
    # Create specialized processor
    stake_processor = StakeLockProcessor(composer)
    tx = stake_processor.create_stake_lock_order(amount, lock_time, reinvest, fee)
    
    # Or use the unified ConditionalProcessor
    from cellframe.composer.cond import ConditionalProcessor
    cond_processor = ConditionalProcessor(composer)
    tx = cond_processor.create_conditional_transaction(...)
