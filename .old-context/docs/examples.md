# üîÑ Live Documentation Session

**Session ID:** `LIVE-2025-01-13-14:30-simd-regression-investigation`  
**Start Time:** `2025-01-13T14:30:00Z`  
**Type:** `investigation`

## üéØ Session Goals

**Primary Goal:** Understand why SIMD shows performance regression in micro-benchmarks

**Expected Duration:** 2-3 hours

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Identify root cause of 60-151% SIMD regression
- [ ] Determine if this affects real-world performance  
- [ ] Create hypothesis for context dependency

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. Why do micro-benchmarks show SIMD regression while Day 1 showed improvement?
2. Is this regression present in real NTT operations?
3. What factors influence SIMD effectiveness?

## üîç Live Activity Log

INSIGHT-14:45: Micro-benchmarks use synthetic data patterns, real NTT has complex memory access

DECISION-14:52: Create real NTT test instead of relying on synthetic benchmarks
- BECAUSE: Contradiction between Day 1 results and micro-benchmarks suggests context dependency
- ALTERNATIVES: Debug micro-benchmarks, trust Day 1 results, ignore contradiction
- CONFIDENCE: high

DISCOVERY-15:23: Real NTT operations show 0.3% SIMD improvement, not regression!
- IMPACT: Resolves contradiction - SIMD works for complex operations, not simple ones
- EVIDENCE: day3_real_ntt_test.c shows 1.003x speedup consistently
- NEXT: Need to understand what makes operations "SIMD-friendly"

INSIGHT-15:45: SIMD effectiveness correlates with computation-to-memory ratio

DATA-16:10: Size dependency analysis shows SIMD improves with larger data sets
- METHOD: Tested 64, 512, 2048, 8192 elements
- RELIABILITY: 25 iterations each, 95% confidence intervals  
- INTERPRETATION: Overhead dominates for small operations, benefits emerge for large operations

## üìà Session Results

**End Time:** `2025-01-13T17:15:00Z`  
**Actual Duration:** 2h 45min

### Achievements
**Completed:**
- [x] Identified root cause: context dependency between simple/complex operations
- [x] Validated that real NTT performance is not affected negatively
- [x] Created comprehensive size dependency analysis
- [x] Established evidence-based framework for SIMD decisions

### Key Learnings

**Major Insights:**
1. SIMD effectiveness depends on operation complexity, not just data size
2. Micro-benchmarks can be misleading for complex algorithmic contexts
3. Evidence-based validation prevents wrong optimization decisions

**Validated Assumptions:**
- Real-world performance matters more than synthetic benchmarks
- Context dependency exists in SIMD performance

**New Questions Raised:**
- What is the exact threshold for SIMD effectiveness?
- How to create representative benchmarks for complex algorithms?

# üîÑ Live Documentation Session

**Session ID:** `LIVE-2025-01-14-10:00-differential-context-design`  
**Start Time:** `2025-01-14T10:00:00Z`  
**Type:** `design`

## üéØ Session Goals

**Primary Goal:** Design self-referential context system without circular dependencies

**Expected Duration:** 3-4 hours

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Architecture that can work with itself safely
- [ ] Zero duplication of information
- [ ] Clear loading hierarchy
- [ ] Working prototype

## üîç Live Activity Log

INSIGHT-10:15: Need hierarchical loading: base ‚Üí working ‚Üí meta levels

DECISION-10:30: Use reference system instead of copying files
- BECAUSE: Eliminates duplication and ensures single source of truth  
- ALTERNATIVES: Copy files, symlinks, inclusion system
- CONFIDENCE: high

DISCOVERY-11:20: Differential approach works - only store differences, not duplicates
- IMPACT: Reduces context size by 70% while maintaining full functionality
- EVIDENCE: Reference system validates successfully
- NEXT: Need to implement conflict resolution for differential data

OBSTACLE-12:45: Circular reference risk when system works on itself
- ATTEMPTED: Naive self-reference approach
- RESOLUTION: Strict hierarchy with "differential takes priority" rule
- WORKAROUND: Clear separation between base, working, and meta levels

INSIGHT-14:30: Self-awareness as a feature, not a bug

DATA-15:45: File reduction metrics
- METHOD: Compare old vs new structure file counts and sizes
- RELIABILITY: Direct measurement of working system
- INTERPRETATION: 70% file reduction, 68% data reduction, 0% duplication

## üìà Session Results

### Key Learnings

**Major Insights:**
1. Self-referential systems need explicit hierarchies to prevent infinite loops
2. Reference systems eliminate duplication more effectively than inclusion
3. Differential storage is powerful for derived contexts

**Methodology Assessment:**

**What Worked Well:**
- Starting with clear principles (no duplication, references over copies)
- Testing each level independently before combining
- Real-time validation of each design decision

**Process Improvements for Next Time:**
- Start with conflict resolution design earlier
- Create test cases for circular reference scenarios
- Document hierarchy rules more explicitly

## üéØ Best Practices from Real Usage

### Real-Time Capture Techniques

**Effective INSIGHT patterns:**
```
‚úÖ INSIGHT-14:23: Template validation should happen incrementally, not at the end
‚úÖ INSIGHT-16:45: SIMD regression correlates with memory access patterns  
‚ùå INSIGHT-15:00: Working on the code (too vague, not actionable)
```

**Effective DECISION patterns:**
```
‚úÖ DECISION-15:30: Switch to real NTT testing
   - BECAUSE: Synthetic benchmarks showed contradictory results  
   - ALTERNATIVES: Debug synthetic tests, trust Day 1 results
   - CONFIDENCE: high

‚ùå DECISION-16:00: Changed the approach (missing rationale and alternatives)
```

**Effective DISCOVERY patterns:**
```
‚úÖ DISCOVERY-11:45: Context dependency in SIMD performance
   - IMPACT: Fundamental understanding changed
   - EVIDENCE: Consistent 23-37% regression in simple ops, 0.3% improvement in complex
   - NEXT: Need systematic analysis of operation complexity factors

‚ùå DISCOVERY-12:00: Found something interesting (not specific enough)
```

### Time Management

**Recommended time allocation:**
- 5% - Session setup and goal setting
- 80% - Actual work with real-time documentation  
- 10% - Results synthesis and learning extraction
- 5% - Next session preparation

**Signs you're over-documenting:**
- More than 20% time spent on documentation
- Documentation interrupts flow state frequently
- Documenting routine actions instead of insights

**Signs you're under-documenting:**
- Can't remember why decisions were made after 1 day
- Losing track of what was tried and didn't work
- Repeating failed approaches

### Evidence Quality

**High-quality evidence examples:**
```
‚úÖ "25 iterations, 95% confidence interval, 0.772x speedup (23% slower)"
‚úÖ "Tested on Apple Silicon M1, release build, 3 independent measurements"
‚úÖ "Consistently reproducible across 5 different data sets"

‚ùå "Seems faster"
‚ùå "Much better performance" 
‚ùå "Probably around 20% improvement"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I don't know what to document"

**Focus on these trigger events:**
- When you're surprised by a result
- When you change direction or approach
- When you discover something wasn't as expected
- When you make a decision between multiple options
- When you figure out why something works/doesn't work

### "Documentation slows me down"

**Efficiency tips:**
- Use abbreviations and shorthand for common terms
- Set up text expansion for common formats (INSIGHT-, DECISION-, etc.)
- Document in batches during natural breaks
- Focus on decisions and insights, skip routine actions

### "I forget to document in real-time"

**Habit formation strategies:**
- Set 30-minute timers to prompt documentation review
- Make documentation part of your git commit process  
- Use templates that include documentation sections
- Start with just DECISION logging, add other types gradually

### "Documentation is inconsistent across team"

**Standardization approaches:**
- Create shared templates and examples
- Regular review of documentation practices
- Pair documentation sessions to share techniques
- Team retrospectives on documentation effectiveness

---
